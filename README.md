# PRODIGY_CS_01
Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryptionÂ andÂ decryption.


ðŸ”’ Task Completed: Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption in Python! ðŸ”’
I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed Task 01 given by Prodigy InfoTech. 
This task involved creating a Python program to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The program allows users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

**Key Features**
Encryption: Transforms your message with a given shift value.
Decryption: Reverts the encrypted message back to its original form.

This project was a fantastic opportunity to delve into the fundamentals of cryptography and enhance my Python programming skills. 


Looking forward to more challenges and learning opportunities ahead!
